##### A version of Snake for the Arduino [DIY Gamer Kit](https://www.techwillsaveus.com/shop/diy-gamer-kit/) from [Technology Will Save Us](http://www.techwillsaveus.com)

This version of Snake has been built as a replacement for the version that comes with the kit.
It features:

+ multiple stages of difficulty (with appropriate score increases for harder difficulties)
+ light inversion as a feedback system
+ support for scores larger than can be displayed on the 8x8 screen
+ movement testing to remove the ability to 180 on the spot (causing instant death)
+ a timed update rate to ensure smooth updating

This project uses none of the code from the original kit Snake project.
